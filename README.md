# BlenderPixelArtFrom3dModel
This might require some experience with blender to get working. 

# **To Enter Rendering Normals**
Add the shader labeled Norm. Remove previous shaders from the model or with Norm selected tab into edit mode, Select all verticies(Press A). Press Assign.(This might be destructive if you have a very spefic model to shaders setup. Save your model first in another file to be sure.)

# **To Exit Rendering Normals**
Go to output, Film and turn on transparent. Bring in your model.

# **Fun Effects!**
To add the outline go to output and turn on freestyle(has to an interger).
To add fun limited retro look go to compositing and add a posterize node
Don't have too much fun with it!
